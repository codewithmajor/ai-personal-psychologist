# backend/models.py
# (For a simple SQLite + direct SQL prototype, we keep DB logic in database.py)
# This file is kept for academic clarity and future extension with ORMs if needed.

# In a more advanced version, you could define ORM models here, e.g., SQLAlchemy models.
# For this M.Tech prototype, low-level SQL in database.py keeps it simple and transparent.
